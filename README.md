# Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration Classification via Machine Learning
In this project, I used random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron models to predict whether or not molecules could penetrate the blood-brain barrier based on nine molecular descriptors. I used the BBBP dataset, a dataset containing the names, SMILES structures, and blood-brain barrier permeability for ~2000 small molecules.
